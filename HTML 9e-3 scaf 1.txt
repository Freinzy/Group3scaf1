  <h2><b>Today and Tomorrow</b></h2>
  <br>
  We have noticed that most citizens of the Philippines are currently suffering problems from the recent 
  pandemic and it is affecting the Filipino citizens mentally and physically. Not only the Philippines has been 
  suffering from this prevalent pandemic but the virus has been out widespread all around the globe. One of 
  the issues that our country is facing today is the increasing number of crimes and the corruption undertaken 
  by the government. People nowadays tend to prioritize themselves first without them realizing that others 
  need help. Instead of helping each other, we blame each other, we pressure each other by deceiving 
  ourselves with lies, we do not unite as one. Hence chaos and discord occur, problems and issues pile up and 
  the country is in the brink of panic. How can we conquer these problems if we don’t bond together? The 
  straightforward answer to this question is that it can’t, it will only worsen the situation we are going in 
  through right now. Government Officials firstly prioritized their wants, their selfishness, and most 
  especially their desires. Nonetheless, if you can’t afford money, you can’t afford justice. If these deeds were 
  to continue, Philippines won’t be a better country for us at all and the future of us, Filipinos, would suffer 
  too.
